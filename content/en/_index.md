The biggest goal every year is to have students lead and run the team. We want our students to be able to explain to any professional engineer what they did, why they did it, what parts were used, and sound like pros all at the same time. Our students know the robot inside and out because they build it from start to finish. While we have advisors and mentors, we make sure the students do the work, while the mentors teach and guide.

## What is FRC?

To quote F.I.R.S.T. (For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology):
>"Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. Itâ€™s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team."
